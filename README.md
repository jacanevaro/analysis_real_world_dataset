# 🏠Predicting Apartment Prices Using Multiple Linear Regression 📈and Random Forest 🌳

This project was an assignment for my machine learning class. It uses a real-world publicly available dataset.

---

## 🔭Project Summary

A simple project designed to teach the use of pipelines 
- Data loading and cleaning
- Pipeline development 
- Model selection and evaluation 
- Data visualization 

The optimal outcome is a model that accurately predicts the **price** of a given apartment.

## ⚙️Tools
- 🐼 **Pandas**
- #️⃣ **Numpy**
- 📊 **Matplotlib**
- 🤖 **Sklearn**

## 📂Dataset 

The dataset includes apartment listings in the U.S. It is available from [UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/555/apartment+for+rent+classified).

### Features
- 🌎 Latitude and Longitude
- 🛏️ Number of bedrooms 
- 🚽 Number of bathrooms
- 💰 Apartment fees (Y/N)
- 🐶 Pets allowed (Y/N)
- 📸 Photo with listing (Y/N)
- 📏 Square footage 
- 💸 Rent (target variable)

## 💡Key Insights
- RMSE for linear regression was too high.
- Random forest gave a better outcome.
